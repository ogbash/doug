 * Generating documentation

Doxygen config file is Doxyfile which is generated from Doxyfile.in by
config.status (configure generated script). If you change configuration file
Doxyfile.in then rerun config.status.

To generate documentation run doxygen from this directory. Directory 'html'
and others are recreated and documentation is updated. See 'html/index.html'
for html main page.

Source directories and files are specified in Doxyfile.in as INPUT_*
configuration parameters.

 * Documenting DOUG

Fortran parser for doxygen currently understands special comments
 1) !> as documentation block start, !> or !! (or !!!) as continuation
!> Brief documentation is first sentence.
!> Continuation ...
!! Continuation ...
 2) !< as back documentation which comes after member to document.
integer :: i !< Documentation for \a i.
