 * Compiling

When fresh checkout from SVN run ./autogen.sh in project
directory. This creates configure script and some other files.

Run ./configure. The exact command depends on location of
libraries. There are several issues with configure that need to be
fixed, but it's not yet clear how.
Examples:
./configure --with-umfpack=/usr/local/src
./configure CPPFLAGS=-I'/usr/local/include/UMFPACKv4.4/ -I/home/markt/src/UMFPACKv4.4/AMD/Include/' --disable-shared

Run make. Executables are in src/main directory.

 * Developing

When adding or removing files appropriate Makefile.am should be updated. Make automatically runs automake in this case, so there is no need to run any other scripts.

Sometimes, eg when Makefile's are not yet generated, it is neccesary to rerun ./autogen.sh and then ./configure.
